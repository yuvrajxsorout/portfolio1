# Yuvraj Sarout
### Doctoral Student

I am Yuvraj Sarout, and I'm currently delving deep into the realms of shape optimization, combining the intricacies of computational fluid dynamics with the transformative power of machine learning during my PhD studies at √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts et M√©tiers in Metz, France. My journey in the field of mechanical engineering started at VIT University, Vellore, India. Here, I honed my skills in automotive engineering and graduated with a B.Tech, boasting an impressive GPA of 8.5/10. Furthering my academic pursuits, I acquired an MSc in Mechanical Engineering from Khalifa University of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi, UAE, achieving a laudable GPA of 3.5/4. Professionally, I've made significant contributions as a Research Associate at Khalifa University of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi, UAE. My research here primarily focused on the intricacies of Flow-induced Vibration, and I became adept at using tools such as ANSYS Fluent for advanced computational fluid dynamic simulations.
